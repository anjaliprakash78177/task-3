    <P  style="font-size: x-large;color: rgb(242, 106, 9);">Chhath Puja is a significant Hindu festival celebrated primarily in Bihar, Jharkhand, and parts of Uttar Pradesh, with roots deeply embedded in mythology and ancient traditions. According to one of the most widespread legends, Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, faced serious challenges during their forest exile. Lord Krishna advised her to observe a day-long fast called Chhath Vratta, which she followed with total commitment. This ensured that her problems were resolved and the Pandavas' exile ended, highlighting the power of faith and devotion in overcoming struggles and obtaining benefits.

        Another prominent legend is associated with Lord Rama and Sita. After their triumphant return to Ayodhya from exile, Sita is said to have performed the Chhath rituals as an act of gratitude to the Sun God, setting a divine standard for future generations. This act not only demonstrated her devotion but also underscored the festival's sacred nature, strengthening its significance in Indian culture. <br>The festival is also linked to King Priyavrata, whose reign was known for its fairness and virtue.</P>
<p style="color: rgb(2, 84, 2) ;font-size: x-large;">The festival is also linked to King Priyavrata, whose reign was known for its fairness and virtue. According to ancient texts, the celebration of Chhath Puja was greatly governed by King Priyavrata, whose father was the famous king Nahusha, and his daughter was Sati Anusuya, a renowned figure in Indian folklore. This legend emphasizes the cultural and spiritual value of the festival and the deep faith that King Priyavrata had in Chhath Puja.</p>
